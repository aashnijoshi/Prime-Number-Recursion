# Checking for Prime Number using Recursion
Using recursion to see if a given number is a prime number or not. The goal of this program is to further comprehend the complex process of Recursion in python

In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science
